BillionDigitsPiAndTau
=====================

IPython notebooks to calculate tau from pi, and analyze both numbers.

Consists of four notebooks:

* run_this_first: converts hex byte files from University of Tokyo to 1 billion decimals
* calculate_tau: converts pi to tau by multiplying chunks
* find_string_patterns: finds regex-style patterns in pi and tau to 1 billion digits
* iterative analyses: performs longer calculations that involve iterating over the digits of pi and tau one by one. Up to 100 million digits can be analyzed in a reasonable time with a desktop computer.
